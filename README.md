# iReadNews

Hey. Maybe you wonder how I'm doing? Even if yes, I do not have RSS feeds ...
But many of your favorite news sites have! This application will help cache the news 
for today so that you can read them in the metro. Connect any RRS-tape and read what you like!

How to use the application:
1. Open it
2. Connect any RSS-feed
3. After that you can add and cache any tape and save them!

So it's open source, so you can screw anything here!
